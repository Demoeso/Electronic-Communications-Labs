# Electronic-Communications-Labs
This repository contains lab work for the Electronic Communications module (Semester 2) completed during my second year of Electronic Engineering.

## Contents

- **Lab 6** – AM (Amplitude Modulation) signal generation and analysis
- **Lab 7** – Frequency Modulation (FM) and signal bandwidth examination
- **Lab 9** – Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis of complex waveforms

## Tools Used
- Python
- Juypter Notebooks (Google Collab)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Purpose
These labs explore fundamental principles in analog and digital communication systems, focusing on modulation techniques, frequency analysis, and signal behaviour.

> All lab work is based on original coursework completed at SETU Carlow and reflects my understanding and application of communication theory using Python.
